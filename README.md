# Wine Quality Prediction

Predicts wine quality using a fine-tuned LightGBM model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with experiment tracking and model management using MLflow.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training using LightGBM
- Model evaluation with MAE and MSE metrics
- Experiment tracking and model management using **MLflow**

## Project Structure

- `data_loader.py`: Functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- `model.py`: Function for defining the LightGBM model.
- `train.py`: Function for training the model and logging experiments with MLflow.
- `config.py`: Configuration file with hyperparameters and settings.
- `main.py`: Main script for running the entire pipeline.

## Notebooks
